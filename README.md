# To Do list - final course project
Final project of Javascipt course

The todo list application combines the simplicity and flexibility of native JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with the convenience of drag and drop functionality for organizing tasks. It is implemented using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and separates the concerns of data management, user interface presentation, and user interactions. 
The integration of d3.js enhances the app's capabilities by providing insightful data visualizations. With its intuitive interface, task management features, drag and drop functionality, and data visualization capabilities, the app offers users an efficient and visually engaging tool for organizing their daily activities and monitoring their productivity.
